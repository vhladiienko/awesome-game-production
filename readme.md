# Awesome Game Production [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> A curated list of **awesome** resources, related to game production process: books, articles, tools, project management, methodologies etc. This list does not cover specific disciplines like game design, quality assurance, programming. Its focus is management and production.

This is **not a collection**, this is a list of the [most awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/main/awesome.md#only-awesome-is-awesome) stuff.

Majority of the provided resources are in English, but I might include items in other languages too, if you help me by [creating a pull request](https://github.com/vhladiienko/awesome-game-production/blob/main/contributing.md). Look for a flag next to the link.

Making sure you're having right documentation at the right time can help you avoid overhead during development big time.


## :wrench: Tools and templates

<sup>[back to top ^](#contents)</sup>

As a producer, you might need a few tools to help you deliver the damn thing. Some of these may not be useful to you directly, but I might have include one if I think you should at least know such a tool exists. This is to help you gain a few credits in your team.


### Tools

- [Machinations](https://machinations.io/) - a tool, that helps prototyping game mechanics, economy flow and states either for production or for demo purposes. This tool has been mentioned by Jesse Schell in his [Book of Lenses](https://amazon.com/dp/1138632058), so its old but it has transformed over the years.
- [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) - a free and [open source](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw) online drawing tool. Neither gamedev or project management related, but is so versatile, I find myself using it quite often.

### Templates

- [Art Asset List template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1G7X_Xzx9P8TONQewx8FDgBgF06pQcRPzz3COvWiHn2U/edit?usp=sharing) - A basic and process agnostic template to keep track of all in-game assets, that need to be produced, their status (high-level) and naming. Should be adjusted to your production pipeline.

## :incoming_envelope: Subscriptions

<sup>[back to top ^](#contents)</sup>

To stay up-to-date, consider subscribing to all or some of the below resources. These are not production related (as in Project Management), but as a producer, you kinda want to know a little bit about everything in gamedev. So pick your poison.

### YouTube

- [GDC](https://www.youtube.com/@Gdconf) - Game Developers Conference YouTube channel, all sorts of talks on anything game development related. It's huge and is updated frequently, but you'll have to filter the information you need.

### Newsletters

- [Deconstructor of Fun](https://www.deconstructoroffun.com/) - not directly production related, but offers in-depth analysis on recent gamedev events, e.g. Brawl Stars ditching lootboxes: why, how and what was the outcome. You want to know about things like this when leading the production of your next mobile action game. And they also have a [podcast](https://pca.st/5tK0).

### Podcasts

- [The Art of LiveOps](https://pca.st/ywLc6I) - this show seems to have ended, but some (if not all) episodes are still relevant. If youre managing a live mobile game, give it a listen.

### Other sources

- [fedoruk.works](https://t.me/beardpm) (<img src="https://github.com/lipis/flag-icons/blob/main/flags/4x3/ua.svg" width="16">) - quality project management content, not game development specific
