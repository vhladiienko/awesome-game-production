## :wrench: Tools and templates

<sup>[back to top ^](#contents)</sup>

As a producer, you might need a few tools to help you deliver the damn thing. Some of these may not be useful to you directly, but I might have include one if I think you should at least know such a tool exists. This is to help you gain a few credits in your team.


### Tools

- [Machinations](https://machinations.io/) - a tool, that helps prototyping game mechanics, economy flow and states either for production or for demo purposes. This tool has been mentioned by Jesse Schell in his [Book of Lenses](https://amazon.com/dp/1138632058), so its old but it has transformed over the years.
- [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) - a free and [open source](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw) online drawing tool. Neither gamedev or project management related, but is so versatile, I find myself using it quite often.

### Templates

- [Art Asset List template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1G7X_Xzx9P8TONQewx8FDgBgF06pQcRPzz3COvWiHn2U/edit?usp=sharing) - A basic and process agnostic template to keep track of all in-game assets, that need to be produced, their status (high-level) and naming. Should be adjusted to your production pipeline.

## :incoming_envelope: Subscriptions
